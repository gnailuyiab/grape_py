# GRAPE algorithm
This is a python implementation for GRAPE algorithm.

The article [Optimal control of coupled spin dynamics: design of NMR pulse sequences by gradient ascent algorithms](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.083604) can be achieved by the link.

Second order method, BFGS, method is also implemented. ref: [Second order gradient ascent pulse engineering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090780711002552)

Features: 
- basic hamiltonian grape method
- BFGS method provided by scipy
- liouvillian based grape method, support arbitrary dissapation
- TODO: GPU based algorithm acceleration
